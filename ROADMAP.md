## Roadmap

- ~~lowercase all words going to predictive storage~~
- ~~do not store punctuation in predictive storage~~
- ~~ensure that word being saved is in dictionary~
- ~~do not allow predicted lowercase 'i' to show with default predicted uppercase 'I'~~
- ~~adding a 'tight' punctuation mark (',', '.', '!', '?') trims space before~~
- ~~after 'tight' punctuation mark, add space~~
- ~~jump to first predictive word after predictive word selected~~
- ~~add apostrophe to punctuation~~
- ~~allow (valid) words with apostrophe to be saved to predictive list~~
- ~~suggest an 's' after apostrophe~~
- make case insensitive when comparing words from predictive (?)
- ~~fix problem where duplicate 'i' appears on same row as 'I' in predictive list~~
- ~~check reason why word 'is' is not saving (it was saving correctly)~~
- ~~show cursor on textarea~
- use [pos-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pos) to predict next word better - i.e. after `is` adjective, adverb comp sup, possessive etc OR not noun sing pl, adverb, verb etc
- ~~predict whether sentence should be a question, and suggest question mark~~
- ~~writing `don'` results in `don's`, should be `don't`~~
- ~~add word to predictive if ends in `nâ€™t` if prior to `n` is dict word: do, does, etc~~
- ~~when backspace to punctuation, nothing suggested -suggest space~~
- ~~after typing `a` suggest a space first, then the `a` suggested words~
- ~~do not save child words after full stop - create new parent word~~
- ~~pause for twice as long when move back to first suggested word~~
- ~~add caps-lock button~~
- add numbers
- highlight predictive words differently
- add punctuation (question mark) to predictive word
- give some visual indicator (perhaps animation) that focus has moved to first predicted word
- use most-used own words instead of default words (perhaps once the count gets above a certain number)
- add a settings screen/row, where speed and auto capitalize can be set
