## Roadmap

- ~~lowercase all words going to predictive storage~~
- ~~do not store punctuation in predictive storage~~
- ~~ensure that word being saved is in dictionary
- ~~do not allow predicted lowercase 'i' to show with default predicted uppercase 'I'~~
- ~~adding a 'tight' punctuation mark (',', '.', '!', '?') trims space before~~
- ~~after 'tight' punctuation mark, add space~~
- ~~jump to first predictive word after predictive word selected~~
- add apostrophe to punctuation
- allow (valid) words with apostrophe to be saved to predictive list
- show cursor on textarea
- highlight predictive words differently
- add punctuation (question mark) to predictive word
- give some visual indicator (perhaps animation) that focus has moved to first predicted word
