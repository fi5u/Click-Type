## Roadmap

- ~lowercase all words going to predictive storage~
- ~do not store punctuation in predictive storage~
- ~ensure that word being saved is in dictionary
- ~do not allow predicted lowercase 'i' to show with default predicted uppercase 'I'~
- adding a 'tight' punctuation mark (',', '.', '!', '?') trims space before
- after 'tight' punctuation mark, add space
- jump to first predictive word after predictive word selected
- show cursor on textarea
- highlight predictive words differently
