## Roadmap

- ~~lowercase all words going to predictive storage~~
- ~~do not store punctuation in predictive storage~~
- ~~ensure that word being saved is in dictionary~
- ~~do not allow predicted lowercase 'i' to show with default predicted uppercase 'I'~~
- ~~adding a 'tight' punctuation mark (',', '.', '!', '?') trims space before~~
- ~~after 'tight' punctuation mark, add space~~
- ~~jump to first predictive word after predictive word selected~~
- ~~add apostrophe to punctuation~~
- ~~allow (valid) words with apostrophe to be saved to predictive list~~
- ~~suggest an 's' after apostrophe~~
- make case insensitive when comparing words from predictive (?)
- ~~fix problem where duplicate 'i' appears on same row as 'I' in predictive list~~
- ~~check reason why word 'is' is not saving (it was saving correctly)~~
- ~~show cursor on textarea~
- use [pos-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pos) to predict next word better
- If word should be capitalized, then predictive word should be
- Add caps-lock button
- Add numbers
- highlight predictive words differently
- add punctuation (question mark) to predictive word
- give some visual indicator (perhaps animation) that focus has moved to first predicted word
