## Roadmap

- ~~lowercase all words going to predictive storage~~
- ~~do not store punctuation in predictive storage~~
- ~~ensure that word being saved is in dictionary~
- ~~do not allow predicted lowercase 'i' to show with default predicted uppercase 'I'~~
- ~~adding a 'tight' punctuation mark (',', '.', '!', '?') trims space before~~
- ~~after 'tight' punctuation mark, add space~~
- ~~jump to first predictive word after predictive word selected~~
- ~~add apostrophe to punctuation~~
- ~~allow (valid) words with apostrophe to be saved to predictive list~~
- ~~suggest an 's' after apostrophe~~
- ~~make case insensitive when comparing words from predictive (?)~~
- ~~fix problem where duplicate 'i' appears on same row as 'I' in predictive list~~
- ~~check reason why word 'is' is not saving (it was saving correctly)~~
- ~~show cursor on textarea~~
- use [pos-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pos) to predict next word better - i.e. after `is` adjective, adverb comp sup, possessive etc OR not noun sing pl, adverb, verb etc
- ~~predict whether sentence should be a question, and suggest question mark~~
- ~~writing `don'` results in `don's`, should be `don't`~~
- ~~add word to predictive if ends in `nâ€™t` if prior to `n` is dict word: do, does, etc~~
- ~~when backspace to punctuation, nothing suggested -suggest space~~
- ~~after typing `a` suggest a space first, then the `a` suggested words~
- ~~do not save child words after full stop - create new parent word~~
- ~~pause for twice as long when move back to first suggested word~~
- ~~add caps-lock button~~
- ~~add numbers~~
- ~~caps lock should activate secondary punctuation on the punctuation row~~
- ~~add a settings screen/row, where speed and auto capitalize can be set~~
- ~~highlight predictive words differently~~
- ~~give some visual indicator (perhaps animation) that focus has moved to first predicted word~~
- use most-used own words instead of default words (perhaps once the count gets above a certain number)
- ~~provide a key explaining symbols (plus display current speed)~~
- ~~persist outputDisplay content~~
- add GA
- ~~support touch - nav text changes to 'tap', detect tap for select~~
- ~~on clicking button, scroll output to bottom~~
- ~~add clear button, (with confirmation)~~
- write the readme
- ~~prevent wrap on rows~~
- ~~caps lock should have a different state when active~~
- ~~after clearing output, change back to lowercase~~
- add shift option to caps lock - shift applies to next letter, caps lock applies until off
- ~~do not set suggested word color of question mark, when in punctuation row~~
- ~~if a capital letter manually set for first letter of word, ensure first letter of suggested word is capitalized~~
- ~~make wrapping better in keys row~
- ~~error: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'birmingham' in undefined~~
- ~~set a default predictive words object, perhaps using something like http://www.englishinuse.net~~
- improve color scheme
- ~~when `a` in suggested words, normal `a` is highlighted, suggested `a` is removed~~
- setup github pages
- import 'Lato' font
