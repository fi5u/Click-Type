## ClickType - a typing aid for those with reduced mobility

ClickType allows typing by selecting characters or suggested words with just a space bar click. It uses predictive logic to suggest appropriate words, as well as words that are common for the user.

### To use

A single space bar click will start sequentially highlighting grid rows. When the row containing the desired character or word is highlighted, another space bar click will select that row and start sequentially highlighting characters. Press space bar again when the character or word is highlighted. Selecting the first character of any row (`⇡`) will go back to highlighting rows.

Each row of letters contain one or many suggested words at the end, based on letters in the current word and/or words that came previously. When a suggested word has been selected, the active position will be moved to the first of the new suggested words.

The last row contains punctuation and function keys. Selecting caps lock (`⇪`) (bottom right) reveals more characters, as well as options to slow down (`«`) or speed up (`»`) the selector timing speed. Selecting caps lock also reveals the clear all key (`×`). After selecting the clear all key, it changes to a confirmation key, which needs to be selected before all the text will clear.

It is not possible to type directly into the text box, however the keys in the grid can be clicked with a mouse to select.

The row at the very bottom of the screen contains symbols showing what function keys represent, as well as the current selector timing speed.

Providing you're not using ClickType in an incognito window, and you do not clear the cache, the text content should persist between browser sessions.
